# Agent Instructions

This file is the primary instruction surface for agents contributing to OpenShell. It is injected into your context on every interaction — keep that in mind when proposing changes to it.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions, task reference, project structure, and the full agent skills table.

## Project Identity

OpenShell is built agent-first. We design systems and use agents to implement them — this is not vibe coding. The product provides safe, sandboxed runtimes for autonomous AI agents, and the project itself is built using the same agent-driven workflows it enables.

## Skills

Agent skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Your harness can discover and load them natively — do not rely on this file for a full inventory. The detailed skills table is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (for humans).

## Workflow Chains

These pipelines connect skills into end-to-end workflows. Individual skill files don't describe these relationships.

- **Community inflow:** `triage-issue` → `create-spike` → `build-from-issue`
  - Triage assesses and classifies community-filed issues. Spike investigates unknowns. Build implements.
- **Internal development:** `create-spike` → `build-from-issue`
  - Spike explores feasibility, then build executes once `state:agent-ready` is applied by a human.
- **Security:** `review-security-issue` → `fix-security-issue`
  - Review produces a severity assessment and remediation plan. Fix implements it. Both require the `topic:security` label; fix also requires `state:agent-ready`.
- **Policy iteration:** `openshell-cli` → `generate-sandbox-policy`
  - CLI manages the sandbox lifecycle; policy generation authors the YAML constraints.

## Vouch System

- First-time external contributors must be vouched before their PRs are accepted. The `vouch-check` workflow auto-closes PRs from unvouched users.
- Org members and collaborators bypass the vouch gate automatically.
- Maintainers vouch users by commenting `/vouch` on a Vouch Request discussion. The `vouch-command` workflow appends the username to `.github/VOUCHED.td`.
- Skills that create PRs (`create-github-pr`, `build-from-issue`) should note this requirement when operating on behalf of external contributors.

## Issue and PR Conventions

- **Bug reports** must include an agent diagnostic section — proof that the reporter's agent investigated the issue before filing. See the issue template.
- **Feature requests** must include a design proposal, not just a "please build this" request. See the issue template.
- **PRs** must follow the PR template structure: Summary, Related Issue, Changes, Testing, Checklist.
- **PRs from unvouched external contributors** are automatically closed. See the Vouch System section above.
- **Security vulnerabilities** must NOT be filed as GitHub issues. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Skills that create issues or PRs (`create-github-issue`, `create-github-pr`, `build-from-issue`) should produce output conforming to these templates.

## Plans

- Store plan documents in `architecture/plans`. This is git ignored so its for easier access for humans. When asked to create Spikes or issues, you can skip to GitHub issues. Only use the plans dir when you aren't writing data somewhere else specific.
- When asked to write a plan, write it there without asking for the location.

## Sandbox Logging (OCSF)

When adding or modifying log emissions in `openshell-sandbox`, determine whether the event should use OCSF structured logging or plain `tracing`.

### When to use OCSF

Use an OCSF builder + `ocsf_emit!()` for events that represent **observable sandbox behavior** visible to operators, security teams, or agents monitoring the sandbox:

- Network decisions (allow, deny, bypass detection)
- HTTP/L7 enforcement decisions
- SSH authentication (accepted, denied, nonce replay)
- Process lifecycle (start, exit, timeout, signal failure)
- Security findings (unsafe policy, unavailable controls, replay attacks)
- Configuration changes (policy load/reload, TLS setup, inference routes, settings)
- Application lifecycle (supervisor start, SSH server ready)

### When to use plain tracing

Use `info!()`, `debug!()`, `warn!()` for **internal operational plumbing** that doesn't represent a security decision or observable state change:

- gRPC connection attempts and retries
- "About to do X" events where the result is logged separately
- Internal SSH channel state (unknown channel, PTY resize)
- Zombie process reaping, denial flush telemetry
- DEBUG/TRACE level diagnostics

### Choosing the OCSF event class

| Event type | Builder | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| TCP connections, proxy tunnels, bypass | `NetworkActivityBuilder` | L4 network decisions, proxy operational events |
| HTTP requests, L7 enforcement | `HttpActivityBuilder` | Per-request method/path decisions |
| SSH sessions | `SshActivityBuilder` | Authentication, channel operations |
| Process start/stop | `ProcessActivityBuilder` | Entrypoint lifecycle, signal failures |
| Security alerts | `DetectionFindingBuilder` | Nonce replay, bypass detection, unsafe policy. Dual-emit with the domain event. |
| Policy/config changes | `ConfigStateChangeBuilder` | Policy load, Landlock apply, TLS setup, inference routes, settings |
| Supervisor lifecycle | `AppLifecycleBuilder` | Sandbox start, SSH server ready/failed |

### Severity guidelines

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| `Informational` | Allowed connections, successful operations, config loaded |
| `Low` | DNS failures, non-fatal operational warnings, LOG rule failures |
| `Medium` | Denied connections, policy violations, deprecated config |
| `High` | Security findings (nonce replay, Landlock unavailable) |
| `Critical` | Process timeout kills |

### Example: adding a new network event

```rust
use openshell_ocsf::{
    ocsf_emit, NetworkActivityBuilder, ActivityId, ActionId,
    DispositionId, Endpoint, Process, SeverityId, StatusId,
};

let event = NetworkActivityBuilder::new(crate::ocsf_ctx())
    .activity(ActivityId::Open)
    .action(ActionId::Denied)
    .disposition(DispositionId::Blocked)
    .severity(SeverityId::Medium)
    .status(StatusId::Failure)
    .dst_endpoint(Endpoint::from_domain(&host, port))
    .actor_process(Process::new(&binary, pid))
    .firewall_rule(&policy_name, &engine_type)
    .message(format!("CONNECT denied {host}:{port}"))
    .build();
ocsf_emit!(event);
```

### Key points

- `crate::ocsf_ctx()` returns the process-wide `SandboxContext`. It is always available (falls back to defaults in tests).
- `ocsf_emit!()` is non-blocking and cannot panic. It stores the event in a thread-local and emits via `tracing::info!()`.
- The shorthand layer and JSONL layer extract the event from the thread-local. The shorthand format is derived automatically from the builder fields.
- For security findings, **dual-emit**: one domain event (e.g., `SshActivityBuilder`) AND one `DetectionFindingBuilder` for the same incident.
- Never log secrets, credentials, or query parameters in OCSF messages. The OCSF JSONL file may be shipped to external systems.
- The `message` field should be a concise, grep-friendly summary. Details go in builder fields (dst_endpoint, firewall_rule, etc.).

## Sandbox Infra Changes

- If you change sandbox infrastructure, ensure the relevant sandbox e2e path succeeds.

## Commits

- Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (scope is optional)
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`
- Sign off on each commit for DCO compliance. Use the `--signoff` option to `git commit` to add the `Signed-off-by` footer to ensure the user's configured email address is used.
- Never mention Claude or any AI agent in commits (no author attribution, no Co-Authored-By, no references in commit messages)

## Pre-commit

- Run `mise run pre-commit` before committing.
- Install the git hook when working locally: `mise generate git-pre-commit --write --task=pre-commit`

## Testing

- `mise run pre-commit` — Lint, format, license headers. Run before every commit.
- `mise run test` — Unit test suite. Run after code changes.
- `mise run e2e` — End-to-end tests against a running gateway. Run for infrastructure, sandbox, or policy changes.
- `mise run ci` — Full local CI (lint + compile/type checks + tests). Run before opening a PR.

## Python

- Always use `uv` for Python commands (e.g., `uv pip install`, `uv run`, `uv venv`)

## Docker

- Always prefer `mise` commands over direct docker builds (e.g., `mise run docker:build` instead of `docker build`)

## Cluster Infrastructure Changes

- If you change gateway deployment infrastructure (e.g., Helm values/templates, gateway image packaging, or deploy logic in `openshell-cli`), update the `debug-openshell-cluster` skill in `.agents/skills/debug-openshell-cluster/SKILL.md` to reflect those changes.

## Documentation

- When making changes, update the relevant documentation in the `architecture/` directory.
- When changes affect user-facing behavior, update the relevant published docs pages under `docs/` and navigation in `docs/index.yml`.
- When changing gateway TOML fields, driver-specific config options, config defaults, or Helm rendering of `gateway.toml`, update `docs/reference/gateway-config.mdx` in the same branch.
- `fern/` contains the Fern site config, components, preview workflow inputs, and publish settings.
- Follow the docs style guide in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.mdx](docs/CONTRIBUTING.mdx): active voice, minimal formatting, no filler introductions, `shell` fences for copyable commands, and no duplicate body H1.
- Fern PR previews run through `.github/workflows/branch-docs.yml`, and production publish runs through the `publish-fern-docs` job in `.github/workflows/release-tag.yml`.
- Use the `update-docs` skill to scan recent commits and draft doc updates.

### Architecture Docs

- Architecture docs are short canonical subsystem overviews, not exhaustive implementation notes.
- Update one of the existing top-level architecture docs before adding a new file.
- Put useful crate-specific details in the relevant crate `README.md`.
- Add a new top-level architecture doc only when explicitly requested or when an RFC-level design needs a stable home.
- Keep architecture docs focused on stable boundaries, data/control flow, invariants, and operational constraints.
- Remove stale detail instead of preserving it by default.
- Do not include testing transcripts, historical debugging notes, long source-file inventories, or field-by-field schema references.
- Put user-facing instructions in `docs/`, broad design proposals in `rfc/`, and temporary plans in ignored `architecture/plans/`.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. If a file looks like it contains secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, etc.), do not stage it.
- Do not run destructive operations (force push, hard reset, database drops) without explicit human confirmation.
- Scope changes to the issue at hand. Do not make unrelated changes in the same branch.
